I'm a data scientist working in the machine learning and visualization group at the [UK Atomic Energy Authority](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/). 

I have a background in Python and C++ development for scientific data analysis and reduction workflows. I have experiance developing machine learning models in both Pytorch and Tensorflow, as well as practical knowledge of scaling models on large HPC systems.
